            <p>
                I am a language enthusiast and avid learner, taking to code as I take to foreign tongues. Just as I work daily with Duolingo to keep those skills sharp, so too do I work to keep my coding up.

                I live in Texas with my cat, Kerberos. I have a variety of hobbies, including knitting, writing, and tabletop role-playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder. In fact, some of my projects have centered on my love of tabletop games - check out the Spell Book or the Character Generator, both of which I worked on with classmates!
